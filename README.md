# Assignment: React 2 β (3 Points Total)

Please refer to the [Canvas Assignment](https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/273395/assignments/1378125) and [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IFQqPvTlgXKRNT1cW7iicL-RhWmWMUXJ7H1OdDldqj0/edit?usp=sharing) for instructions on completing this assignment. You should copy your code from your React 2 α project to this repository, as that will be your starter code. When you commit and push, ensure that you are commiting and pushing to this react2-beta repository, not react2-alpha. 

Your deliverable will be the following: 
1. Completed Google Doc, attached to the canvas assignment as a PDF
2. GitHub Classroom repository name and latest commit hash, entered in the Canvas assignment as a comment (e.g. `react2-beta-osori, 91ddcb6`)
